# Welcome to the Lamplight API php client Version 2

> This v2 branch is not complete and should not be used.  In due course it will be installable via
composer.  The API of the client will be retained as far as possible to allow for easier migration
from version 1.


The Lamplight publishing module allows you to interact with a Lamplight system.  You can request certain types of
record and insert and update others.

Lamplight comes with a set of built-in widgets that allow you to use the publishing module that are sufficient
for many cases.  Sometimes however you'll need to customise your integration beyond what's available through
the built-in widgets.  That's where the api and php client come in.

This repository holds the php client to use with the API, as well as the documentation for both the API and the client.
Documentation was available at www.lamplight-publishing.co.uk but this will soon be deprecated, not least because
it relates to the original version of the php client.

Notes on the differences between the previous version and this one 
[are available at https://mattparker.github.io/lamplight-phpclient/upgrade_v2_notes.html](https://mattparker.github.io/lamplight-phpclient/upgrade_v2_notes.html)
